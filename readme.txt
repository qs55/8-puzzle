Libraries like numpy, heapq and copy will need to be installed to run the code directly because it is using them.

This code was written, compiled and tested using Pycharm Community Edition. To run this program
in Pycharm, create a new project and import both files called "main.py" and "priority_queue.py" in the project.
Then, we will need to build the solution and run it using relevant Python Interpreter.
